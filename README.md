# FizzBuzz-TDD
This was my first project that used Test-Driven Development and GTest. It was created by following along Richard Wells' Udemy course on TDD.

Test-Driven Development is an iterative three-stage loop, designed to catch bugs at the lowest level.
1. Write a failing test.
2. Write the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test.
3. Refactor.

<b>Benefits of TDD:</b>

1. It gives you more confidence to change code.
2. Gives you immediate feedback.
3. Free documentation!
4. Helps Object-Oriented Design by dividing up functionality into the smallest possible blocks.

To complete this example, I iterated through the stages using the following tests:

 1. Successfully call FizzBuzz
 2. Return "1" when I pass in 1.
 3. Return "2" when I pass in 2.
 4. Return "Fizz" when I pass in 3.
 5. Return "Buzz" when I pass in 5.
 6. Return "Fizz" when I pass in 6 (a multiple of 3)
 7. Return "Buzz when I pass in 10 (a multiple of 5)
 8. Return "FizzBuzz" when I pass in 15.

An arguably trivial example, perhaps? But you've gotta start somewhere. Most of the time was spent fiddling with XCode as per.
